					<li>infrastructure complexity</li>

				</ul>
				<p>Most IT departments and companies simply cannot satisfy the demands of both business and IT requirements. Heard the saying: you're only as strong as your weakest link?<br><br>Consider the pace at which technology develops. More of a muchness has served to complicate each and every area within the business landscape - more tools, more integrations, more silos ... all governed by a multitude of devices, dashboards and management systems. These risks to the IT Dept. are further influenced by geo-logistical factors and time zone constraints</p>
